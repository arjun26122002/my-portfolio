            I am a Computer Science graduate and Software Engineer with almost 2 years of experience in full-stack
            development. I build scalable and user-centric web applications using React.js, Node.js, and TypeScript
            with modern backend frameworks.

            Currently, I also work as a team lead for a 14-member development team, executing tasks like task planning,
            code reviews, and coordination for delivery. I act as an important owner of dependencies throughout projects,
            ensuring smooth collaboration among development, marketing, and stakeholders.

            I contribute to client documentation, technical specifications, management, and accountability documents
            that support clear communication and execution. I love building reliable software, mentoring team members,
            and driving projects from concept to delivered success.
